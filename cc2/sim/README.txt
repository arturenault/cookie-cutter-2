The player calls the methods cutter() and cut().
The cutter() method returns a shape of a given size.
Each shape is represented using a class "Shape".
A shape is generated by giving a set of points.
The shape class then normalizes the points
(moving the points so that minimum x and y are both 0)
and also computes all possible permutations.
The permutations are also accessible from within the class.
Each cut() call includes the index of the cutter, the index
of the rotation of that cutter, and the initial point to
apply the cut. For example the shape (0,0),(1,0),(2,0)
applies to point (3,6) by cutting (3,6),(4,6),(5,6).
To check the locations in the dough you can use the
Dough class. You can also generate your own Dough class
to "simulate" the game without returning moves to the
simulator. The command line arguments are:
--groups <gX> <gY>    (group X also plays first)
--gui-fps <t>         (set milliseconds per frame and set GUI)
--gui                 (set GUI)
--cutter-timeout <t>  (set timeout in ms for cutter() method)
--cut-timeout <t>     (set timeout in ms for cut() method)
